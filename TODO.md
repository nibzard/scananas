# Freeform Idea Map — Engineering TODO

Status: MVP planning in progress. Source: SPECS.md (schema v1).

## Conventions

- Status: use `todo | in-progress | blocked | review | done`.
- Scope tags: `[mvp]`, `[post-mvp]`, `[tech]`, `[qa]`.
- IDs: prefix by area (e.g., `DM-1`, `CAN-3`). Keep stable.
- Owners: `@github-handle` or `unassigned`.
- Keep items one-line; details live in issues/PRs.
- Update status on merge; link PR/issue in the item.

## Maintenance Style Guide (for this TODO.md)

- Keep this file the single source of truth for scope and status. Open issues must reference an item ID; items link back to issues/PRs.
- When starting work: change `status` to `in-progress`, add owner, add issue link.
- When blocked: set `blocked` and add a brief reason inline.
- On PR merge: set `done`, link PR, and add any follow‑ups as new items.
- For new ideas: add under correct area with `[post-mvp]` unless explicitly approved for current milestone.
- Keep lines concise. Move discussion and specs to issues, docs, or code comments.
