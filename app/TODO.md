## Maintenance Style Guide (for this TODO.md)

- Keep this file the single source of truth for scope and status. Open issues must reference an item ID; items link back to issues/PRs.
- When starting work: change `status` to `in-progress`, add owner, add issue link.
- When blocked: set `blocked` and add a brief reason inline.
- On PR merge: set `done`, link PR, and add any followâ€‘ups as new items.
- For new ideas: add under correct area with `[post-mvp]` unless explicitly approved for current milestone.
- Keep lines concise. Move discussion and specs to issues, docs, or code comments.
